    <u><h3>
      Motivations
      </h3></u>
    <p>
      Our motivation to choose this problem and deeper analyzation is because Greenhouse Gas Emissions across the supply chain 
      are key to measure and have an understanding of when we see CO2 levels rising in our environment
      and having a significant effect on climate change. Being eco-friendly continues to be a major topic
      within our generation and know that changes are happening with some of the products we use everyday. With this in mind,
      we wanted to learn more about how the food 
      we are farming and eating everyday contribute to the problems facing the environment. 
      It is important to inform the consumer and manufacturers so that they can understand 
      how the food emissions from the supply chain affect the global GHG emissions and in 
      turn its risks.

    </p>
      
    <h2><strong>
      Design &amp; Development Process
      </strong></h2>
       <p>
      For this project, we explored a few datasets and eventually decided to use several datasets revolving around CO2 production and the global food supply chain. 
      We quickly found the data set needed a lot of cleaning, 
      so we first did that! Once we had those data sets going, it helped us build a storyline through it and connect
         all the visualizations together. But overall, we thought
      it was an interesting topic to work on and found that the data sets would work well for this assignment.

    <u><h3>
      Struggles
      </h3></u>
    <p>
      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Struggle 1:</strong>
          Usefulness -  
          Adding hovers, highlights, and tooltips to the visualizations was extremely useful for 
          the design component as well as to the functionality of the application. 
          It gave the users a better sense of what visualization they were on when 
          they scrolled down the page. 

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Struggle 2:</strong>
          Usability -
          A minor problem was getting the Tableau world maps to properly fit within the screen size 
          so it didnâ€™t become too big to scroll on. This led to us to play around with D3 
          and Vega-lite as other options to help make this map. This taught us a lot about 
          trial and error.

        </li>
        <li>
         <strong> Struggle 3:</strong>
          Storyline Clarity -
          The learnability of our application is high in the sense that our users knew the topics and 
          storyline we wanted them to follow. When we were able to hear their opinions of 
          what the visualizations were showcasing, that helped us re-work wording and details 
          of certain graphs.

        <li>
         <strong> Struggle 4:</strong>
          Data Variation -
          One of the struggles we had was how to focus on more data variations and not design variations.
          This played into part of our usefulness and storyline clarity struggles. Before receiving feedback
          on our storyboard, a lot of our visualizations we didn't really realize were using the same data fields 
          but being shown in different
          ways so that made it harder for us to connect all the visualizations and connect a deeper story to it. Once we were
          able to find more datasets that opened up the storyline, our group was able to focus on a beginning, middle,
          and end conclusion to ensure that it all flowed nicely.
        </li>
     
      </ul>
    <p></p>
    
    <u><h3>
      Lessons Learned
      </h3></u>
    <p>
      </p><ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lesson 1:</strong> More visualizations doesn't always mean that it will always help the audience understand
          a dataset more! Our group learned more how true this was as we continued to work on this project but we didn't want to try
          to complicate the visualizations with the massive amounts of information included in the dataset. In order to
          create a clean storyboard, we had to work really hard together to focus on which fields were most
          important in highlighting the key notes we wanted the audience to learn.
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong> Lesson 2:</strong> Another lesson we learned was the importance of color palettes within our website. Color increases 
          recognition, highlights important website elements and influences how people feel about the website when 
          they scroll through it. At first we didn't have a set color being used but chose to focus on green as that usually best
          relates to the topic and ensured that it was used consistently throughout the flow of the site. Sometmes a lot of color can 
          interfere with the effect of the a visualization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lesson 3:</strong> A lot of the datasets we found were not very clean and had a lot of fields we did not need. This taught us a lot about
          really looking through the data and being detailed about what we were using. Being able to cross check if there were ever overlaps in the data
          or missing information, then we would have to either clean it or keep searching for sets that had all the essential data in there. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lesson 4: </strong> For the group collaboration aspect of this project, our group never had a difficult time deciding on a time to meet
          when it was important for us to make sure everyone was on the same page with what we wanted to do with the project. Communication
          is extremely important especially with projects like this (coding) since we had to be combining all our different visualizations
          we were working into the storyline. We were flexible in how to go about changing and coming up with different ideas!
