      <center>An Introduction to Greenhouse Gases</center>
    </h2>
    <div class="row">
      <p>
        A <i>greenhouse gas (GHG)</i> is a gas that contributes to the
        “greenhouse effect” which traps heat within the Earth’s atmosphere
        causing the Earth's temperature to rise. GHG's have been increasing
        dramatically over the past century, and there are many reasons for this.
        Some of these causes are difficult to provide solutions for, like fossil
        fuels. Much of the world relies on fossil fuels for energy production--
        so solving this problem is not so straight forward. However, there are
        some other factors which can be more easily mitigated, if we just change
        our own consumption methods. The factor we are speaking to specifically
        here is Food. The Food Supply Chain is one of the largest producers of
        GHG's (namely CO2); and, as the world populations continue to rise, the
        need for food has also risen dramatically. <sup>1</sup> <br />
        <br />In this data visualization story, we will be answering the
        question
        <strong
          >"How much of an impact does food production have on global greenhouse
          gas emissions?"
        </strong>
        with the hopes of providing information that can be used to allow our
        viewers to more readily understand not only their own role in the
        production of GHG's via their consumption of food, but to also hopefully
        provide possible solutions to help curb this growing problem.

      <center>CO2 Production: A Growing Problem</center>
    </h2>
    <div class="column">
      <p>
        <br />
        Carbon dioxide emissions are the main driver behind the climate change
        problem that we face in today's society. This global problem is widely
        known, and it is commonly recognized that these emissions need to be
        <i>dramatically</i> decreased, immediately. 

        <center style="font-size:18px"><strong
          >We know that atmospheric CO2 concentration has been a growing
          problem, but how bad has it gotten?</strong></center>
        <p>
        This chart shows the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere measured
        over the past two thousand years. As you can see, the atmospheric CO2
        concentration remained relatively stagnant at 280 parts/million until
        the 1800s. Likely due to the technological and agricultrual boom of the
      1800's, CO2 emissions began to climb. </p>

      <center style="font-size:18px"> <strong><i>And it has yet to slow down.</i> </strong></center>
        <p>
        As you can see, the atmospheric CO2 concentration is increasing
        exponentially. And, in the future, it does not seem like it is going to
        slow down. As population continunes to increase, more energy and food
        will need to be produced, and thus, the CO2 concentration will continue
        to increase.<sup>2</sup>

      <center>CO2 Production: Global Trends by Country</center>
    </h2>

    <div class="column">
      <p>
        <br /><br />
        From the above visualization, it is apparent that the CO2 concentration
        in the atmosphere is increasing exponentially. But, in order to draw
        conclusions about it, and to then philosophize how the issue could
        possibly be mitigated, we need a bit more information.
      </p>
        <br /><br />
        <center style = "font-size:35px"><strong>Who's producing all of it? Who's to blame?</strong></center>
        <br /><br />
      <p>
         As we saw in the first visualization, atmospheric CO2 concentration
        really started to increase in the 19th century. But, it actually began
        increasing at the greatest rate in the early 20th century. To the right
        of this description, is a scatterplot that extends from 1920 to the
        present day. As you can see, the CO2 production of the nations who
        produce the most CO2 generall was increasing-- some faster than others,
        but nearly all following a steady, positive linear slope. Specific
        conclusions that can be drawn speak to the nations that produce the most
        CO2-- China and the US. As the world's total CO2 production has more
        than tripled over the past 100 years, these two players were main
        producers of CO2.

        We have seen that CO2 emissions have been on the rise and certain countries emit 
        a lot of GHGs into the atmosphere. But what consumer sectors exactly are producing all of these harmful emissions?
        It's not surprising to see that transportation and electricity generation 
        are the sectors with the highest percent of GHG emissions, but what about smaller, supposedly 'greener' sectors? 
        <br><br>
        
        For this story, we chose to deep dive into the <strong>agriculture sector</strong>. 
        Even though agriculture is generally considered a smaller producer, we as a group looked at our daily habits and 
        decided that insight from this data might help us help ourselves and the environment. 
        Hopefully by analyzing food, we would be able to see what 
        specifics of the food industry are causing the biggest problems.

          Now that we know what's going on, how serious it is that global levels of CO2 are rising, 
          who the major players and contributors are, and we heve decided to look closely into the the agriculture
          sector, it's time to take a closer look at what exactly these contributions are that come from the Global Food Supply Chain.
          <br><br>
          The first button, the Land Use Graph, shows the user which food products are, on average, growing in land covereage the most per year by Hectare, 
          thus causing them to contribute more GHG's to the atmosphere. This allows for interesting inferences into consumer demand as well.
          The second graph provides us information about which foods, on average, produce the most green house gases, regardless of how much earth-coverage 
          they require, considered on a global scale.
          <br><br>
          As is apparent, the <strong> dairy industry</strong> and dairy products emit the <i>highest</i> amount of CO2 and other GHG's to 
          the atmosphere (especially when considereing the possible aggregation of data points, for example: Chocolate as a combination of dairy and cocoa.

        Even though the meat and dairy industry are known to release large
        amounts of greenhouse gases, we thought it would be interesting to analyze the countries who produce the most GHG's, specifically through
        their food supply chains. In the above vizualizations, we offer two different views of this data. 
        <br><br>
        In the bubble chart, the size of the bubble is encoded on the amount of GHG's the country emits via their food supply chain. 
        Thus, the larger bubbles are representative 
        of countries that are reponsible for more GHG production from their food supply chain. 
        On the click of a bubble, a new bar graph will appear that breaks down this GHG production further-- it tells 
        us the products that each country produces that are the greatest producers (themeselves) of GHG's. 
        The color of the bubble is indivative of which product was the highest GHG producing item in that country.
        For example, there is a lot of light green in the bubble chart-- this is because most countries highest GHG producing product is whole milk!
        <br><br>
        The other view we present is a map. The darker the shade of green the country is, the more GHG emissions from its food supply chain 
        it is responsible for. As we can see China, the US, and India are the darkest shade of green
        which means they are responsible for producing food products that emit the more GHGs.

        This grouped bar chart shows two different things. The dark green bar is representative of the percentage of global 
        green house gas emissions each country is responsible for. The light green bar is the percentage of each country's green house gas production
        that comes from the food supply chain in that country. From this, we can infer a bit more of the causality of these emissions.
        It makes sense that China and Indonesia have a large fraction of their
        total GHG emissions coming from food production, because they have such large populations, that they must produce more food than other nations 
        in order to keep everyone fed. 
        <br><br>
        So now we understand that different countries produce different food products and those food products release a different amount of GHGs into our atmosphere.
        For example, chocolate was the highest global GHG producing food product, but it wasn't any countries single highest export. Whole milk was one
        of the most common products a country would produce.

          This graph shows us CO2 Emissions when compared to a countries population and GDP. The bigger the bubble, the more populated that country is
          and the closer the bubble gets to the right, the higher its GDP. The United States is the top right larger yellow bubble while China is the largest green
          bubble with a smaller GDP. It is interesting to see how even though China looks like it does not produce a lot of CO2, we have to account for this
          visualization being per capita and China having a large population/large capita.
          <br><br>
           Now that we have a bit more context, and we see the impact each country commits to this global problem we can return to the original question at hand.
          <strong>How much of an impact does food production have on global greenhouse gas emissions?</strong> 
          What was the point of all of this data?

          This graph helps answer that question a little further. It shows us how the CO2 emissions have changed 
          in the past few decades. As we can see, there has been a general trend for food production emissions
          to be <i>increasing</i> as the global GDP increases. Even though this is not ideal, we see that around the early 2010s,
          the GHG emission rate starts to level off. This is important because it means that countries started taking account
          of what GHGs they produce and started to make an effort to lessen the amount of emissions they released
          
          <br><br>
          We learned in the beginning the food produced GHGs only account for about 10% of the global GHG emissions, but
          we learned later on that some countries are more impacted by food produced GHGs than others. For example, China
          has a large percentage of GHGs coming from food emissions. We also learned that chocolate is the food product producing the highest
          levels of GHG emissions, while whole milk was deemed the most common food product per each country to produce the most GHG
          emissions. We found it interesting how whole milk and chocolate were the two biggest perpetrators of GHG emissions.
          It wasn't clear at first how they linked together but upon further analysis we determined that chocolate needs milk to be produced, so the chocolate
          data point is essentially combined with some aspects of milk causing it to be so high. 
          <br><br>
          As students who are still growing and have a chance to make a real impact on our environment, we enjoyed this storyboard because it showed us what
          foods cause the most amount of GHGs to be released into the atmosphere. We learned to avoid not only meat as the media states, but also milk, chocolate
          and a variety of oils such as palm oil. It is encouraging to learn that food production emissions are lowering and continuing to lower as a nation's GDP
          increases and the country acknowledges the serverity of climate change and CO2 emissions, but it is our job to continue to be aware of what emissions are
